President Obama is challenging Americans to build an America that is the best version of itself.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of bruising partisan battle, culminating in a devastating midterm election for the president and his party, Mr. Obama is clearly attempting to regain the piece of his 2008 brand that was all about transcending partisan politics. It was an appeal that independent voters responded to during his race for the White House and those very same voters have been coming back to his fold in recent polls. This speech is aimed squarely at trying to keep them there.\r\n\r\nIn his prepared remarks, President Obama was expected to refer to both “Democrats and Republicans” and urge them to work “together” no fewer than a total of 13 times. (That’s nearly double to the joint “Democrats and Republicans” appeal and the push to do things “together” compared to last year, but who’s counting?)\r\n\r\nNowhere in this speech is there talk of abortion, climate change, or gun control.  Those partisan trip wires have been replaced by innovation, education, infrastructure, all of which are potential areas of real bipartisanship.\r\n\r\n"

And certain aspects of his speech echo FDR’s New Deal agenda, such as the call for public works and infrastructure development. But FDR grew more radical on economic issues during his first term, culminating in the passage of Social Security and the Wagner labor relations act in 1935. With this speech, Obama is deliberately moving in the opposite direction. Cases in point: his call to lower the corporate tax rate and to freeze federal spending (though, one should note, FDR did gesture toward balancing the budget). Still, the two men do share at least one overarching characteristic: groping toward the middle. In Roosevelt’s case, that meant finding a path that would save the U.S. from fascism on one side and communism on the other. By comparison, Obama’s job should be simple. But FDR had one advantage that Obama may never see again: a unified and supportive Democratic Congress."

And those were very effective speeches. There was one thing that was lacking though. Unlike Clinton there was no moment where he said the era of big government is over. It was pretty unapologetic in his activism. And that sets up oddly, in a very bipartisan speech, a large contrast with the Republicans. Ideological contrast. They think we’re in a fiscal crisis that requires a revisiting of the role of government itself. And that’s really not what Obama talked about in this speech."

I don’t think there was any policy breakthrough here. He talked about a five year freeze, but he talked in last year’s State of the Union about a three-year freeze. He talked about tax increases that he’s been talking about since the primaries. There were really no specifics on Social Security or Medicare. Maybe that will come in the budget, maybe there’ll be more when it comes. But it was not a real emphasis of the speech.\r\n"

Educational improvements. for example, will not happen immediately. We've been trying to do this for decades already with little to show for it, so we shouldn't expect things to improve overnight. And if reform does eventually happen, it will be many years after that before better educated students begin to enter the workforce. \r\n\r\nAnother initiative from the President, investment in infrastructure, is a little better in terms of how long it takes to create jobs. There will be additional jobs as the infrastructure is under construction, and more jobs in the long run when it enhances our productivity. But we must first get these programs through Congress and that will take time - if it can be done at all given the opposition from the GOP. And if and when a program does eventually get through Congress, it will take even more time before the first shovel hits the dirt. I like the ideas I heard from the president, but what about our more immediate job problem? How do we help those who need a job right now? Solving the more immediate job problem needs to be first and foremost on our national agenda, but this was not addressed in the speech."

If we were a rational universe with cerebral people like Obama in all the political offices, we could do all these things. But you know what, that's not the case. The thing I thought was politically smart was, if you noticed, he didn't ignore entitlement programs, but he mentioned them just enough to goad the Republicans into getting more specific. He's not drawing lines in the sand or saying don’t touch Social Security. It's a tougher -- and I would say shrewder -- approach, by saying we have to deal with these things and then baiting Republicans, the Paul Ryan Republicans, to specifically address them. It's a game of chess, with both sides circling one another. And then you’ve got Michele Bachmann over there making Paul Ryan look moderate."

I estimate well under one quarter of Americans remember that moment, but surely most of us have at least studied it in school. It was one more way the president tried to paint a picture of a United States that can rise to the occasion and can overcome a seeming disadvantage when it has to. At a moment when millions can't find a job, when China seems headed to become the world's economic power, Mr. Obama clearly saw one challenge was to inspire his countrymen and women to believe things will get better, that their nation can prevail."

Here's an excerpt concerning President Obama's remarks:\r\n\r\nAs for the content of the mostly uninterrupted one hour and nine minutes of actual talk, the President focused on a problem that has been growing for decades: how the world has changed. China, he said, now boasts the world's fastest computer, the world's largest solar research center. By contrast, the U.S. is ninth in college graduation rates.\r\n\r\nYet all is not lost.\r\n\r\n\"Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But...\" - and this is the crucial \"but\" of a Democratic President - \"because it's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout history our GOVERNMENT [emphasis added] has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need. That's what planted the seeds for the Internet. That's what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.\"\r\n\r\nI.e.: much-maligned government has a role to play in the economy, my fellow Americans, and let's not forget it. The most memorable line from this part of the President's argument: \"This is our generation's Sputnik moment.\" Given that Russia's Sputnik was launched more than half a century ago, and that the economic payoff from the space race is still hard to demonstrate, it was a line perhaps better left unuttered.

I don’t think it has to be. There is plenty of room for Democrats to embrace some key Republican ideas and still accomplish their objectives.\r\n\r\nDemocrats could embrace the Republican notion of more individual responsibility without giving up on their goal of making affordable health care available to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe most controversial elements of the bill such as the individual mandate and the “Cadillac” tax on expensive benefits could be jettisoned if Democrats would embrace concepts of more individual choice and responsibility such as placing limits on how rich a plan would be eligible for tax preferences and if consumers had more health benefit choices.\r\n\r\nIf Republicans and Democrats really are willing to give and take, they could make most Americans happy with health care reform."

The UK has embraced austerity and taken steps to balance the budget. The idea was that this would create confidence and spur recovery. However, the dismal GDP growth figures released today for the UK tell us we should be very cautious about cutting spending or raising taxes before the economy is on firmer footing that it's on presently. \r\n\r\nFortunately for us, Congress moves slowly. That works in our favor here. But with the president signaling such an openness to work with the GOP on this issue, a more immediate and harmful move toward deficit reduction is not out of the question. I would have liked to have heard the president make clear that while deficit reduction must be addressed, we need to be careful not to hit our still fragile economy with a shock it is not ready to withstand."

While this sounds courageous, it's actually the easy way out since it avoids tough choices on which programs to cut and which programs to preserve. It is also not optimal for the economy because per capita cuts in some programs will be much more painful than in others. \r\n\r\nA better way to do this, and hopefully what will actually happen, is to cut back (or eliminate) the programs that provide the least value, and maintain or perhaps even expand those that provide critical services to citizens. Thus, if the freeze is across the board, it could be quite disruptive to some programs and to the economy. If it is done wisely, the pain from the cuts could be much less."

For example, he has been calling for a corporate tax reform that broadens the base and lowers the rates for as long as I can remember.  As President, he lurched sharply to the left, perhaps because he was driven there by his own party, but perhaps because the temptations of power induced him to reveal his true preferences.  \r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is that President Obama could appear to veer to the right in response to the collapse of the Democratic power structure simply by rehashing his old campaign speeches.   His willingness to put forward genuine proposals is the true acid test of whether he intends to govern as the moderate he portrayed on the campaign trail, or whether he simply will maintain an impotent pretense of  moderation.  \r\n\r\nThis speech was remarkable free of hard substance, suggesting that Obama is a reluctant centrist who only talks a good game.  The five year spending freeze, the only significant precise substance, is painfully inadequate given that spending is currently about $800 billion higher than it was in 2008.  If he succeeds, he will have locked in the biggest short term expansion of government in modern times.  "

To simplify, domestically, he has the American people writ large who are mixed about the war, and his political base on the left who largely want out.  Internationally, he has a fraying coalition of countries in Afghanistan who are looking to the United States for leadership, the Afghanistan people writ large who don’t want the country handed over to the Taliban, and those the United States and its partners are trying to defeat (the Taliban and al-Qaida forces) who obviously want us gone.  Unfortunately, his message to his domestic base (that we’ll start pulling out by July 2011) is undercutting the message of staying until the mission is done that our international/Afghan partners and enemies need to hear. \r\n\r\nI would have preferred, as would many counterinsurgency practitioners and experts, that the president dropped July from his Afghanistan vernacular altogether and focused on 2014 – a more realistic time frame to truly measure success given that this war was not properly resourced until 2010, and the year when Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said he would like his government to have full security control of the country.\r\n"

Thankfully, calmer heads prevailed.  The Senate listened to the advice of elder statesmen and the military’s top leadership and ratified the treaty in the lame duck session at the end of last year.\r\n\r\nThe country can be thankful this was the outcome.

Compared to all other modern presidents, tonight’s speech had virtually no positive or negative emotion words.  Even the word “I” was rarely heard.  As always, his language betrayed complex and nuanced thinking but, compared to previous years, he was far more concrete and specific in his arguments than in the past.\r\n\r\nThis was a fascinating presidential speech from someone whose language was distant, impartial, and cool.  Even more than his previous SOTUs, Obama has created a style that no Americans have seen in a U.S. president."

His line praising teachers was an exception: when he called on American young people to go into teaching, he got a sustained standing ovation.\r\n\r\nBut the most enthusiastic interruptions for applause came near the end: everyone stood and cheered at the line no one could disagree with: \"And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn’t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a speech that sought to inspire, to lift visions.  With several references to  Americans' \"can do\" spirit and ability, the President presented an optimistic face to the daunting challenges that lie ahead, the sort of message his re-election campaign will want to adopt.  Is it a coincidence that time and again, American voters have chosen the more optimistic candidate to be president?\r\n"
